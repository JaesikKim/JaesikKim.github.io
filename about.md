I'm a research engineer at Ajou University in South Korea. My interests of research are Biomedical Informatics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Graph Neural Network, Alzheimer's Disease, Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS), and Multi-omics Integration. \
I will join Kim lab at the University of Pennsylvania as Junior Bioinformatician soon!
